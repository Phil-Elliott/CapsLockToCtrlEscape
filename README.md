# CapsLockToCtrlEscape

This AutoHotkey script, `CapsLockToCtrlEscape.ahk`, is designed to enhance keyboard efficiency, especially for users of Vim or Vim-like environments. It remaps the Caps Lock key to serve dual purposes: as a Control key when held down and as an Escape key when tapped quickly. Additionally, it allows toggling the actual Caps Lock functionality by pressing both Shift keys together.

## Features

- **Caps Lock as Control**: Hold down Caps Lock to use it as the Control key.
- **Caps Lock as Escape**: A quick tap on Caps Lock acts as an Escape key, which is highly beneficial for Vim users.
- **Toggle Caps Lock State**: Press both Shift keys simultaneously to toggle the traditional Caps Lock state on or off.

## Installation

1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) on your Windows machine.
2. Download `CapsLockToCtrlEscape.ahk` from this repository.
3. Double-click the script to run it. Optionally, you can add the script to your startup folder so it runs automatically when Windows starts.

## Usage

Once the script is running:
- Press and hold Caps Lock to use it as a Control key.
- Tap Caps Lock quickly to use it as an Escape key.
- Press both Shift keys together to toggle Caps Lock on or off.

## Customization

You can modify the script to change the tap duration for the Escape functionality or to remap different keys based on your preference.
